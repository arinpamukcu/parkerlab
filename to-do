% run olanzapine pose
% run olanzapine custom feats

% time and event rate spent plots:
- Change from fraction to %
- Remove rest and move (or move them to the right end so it can be removed if needed)
- For the rest of the behaviors, accelerate, decelerate, turn right, turn left, other, (and rearing, grooming once we have it), make total time equal to 100%
- Separate drug plots from vehicle ctrl and amph
- Show high-dose drugs for both ctrl and amph
- Normalize drug ctrl and amph to vehicle ctrl and amph so you only display change in time

pie chart for time spent doing actions:
- grooming (binary)
- rearing (binary)
- speed (discretized)
- acceleration (discretized)
- turning (discretized)
